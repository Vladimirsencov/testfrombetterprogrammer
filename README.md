# Test from betterprogrammer

1) Implement the method to return the sum of all integers found in the parameter String. You can assume that integers are separated from other parts with one or more spaces (' ' symbol).
For example, s="12 some text 3  7", result: 22 (12+3+7=22).

2)Please implement this method to return a list of all prime numbers in the given range (inclusively). A prime number is a natural number that has exactly two distinct natural number divisors, which are 1 and the prime number itself.
The first prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

3)A root-to-leaf path in a tree is a path from a leaf node through all its ancestors to the root node inclusively. 
A "root-to-leaf sum" is a sum of the node values in a root-to-leaf path. Please implement the method to return the largest root-to-leaf sum in the tree.

4)Please implement this method to return the number of different combinations of US coins(penny: 1c, nickel: 5c, dime: 10c, quarter: 25c, half-dollar: 50c)
which may be used to produce a given amount of money.

For example, 11 cents can be produced with one 10-cent coin and one 1-cent coin,two 5-cent coins and one 1-cent coin, 
one 5-cent coin and six 1-cent coins,or eleven 1-cent coins. So there are four unique ways to produce 11 cents. Assume that the cents parameter is always positive.
